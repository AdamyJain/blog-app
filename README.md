## About The Project

[![product-screenshot]]

Created a blog web application for multiple users to write their stories and share them to other users. This project is a MERN stack web application using various elements such as React hooks, Context API.

What I learnt in this project:
* Basics of React.js by creating various react components.
* Using CSS to make a web application responsive and easy to update.
* Creating a backend server using Express.js and Node.js, also creating various APIs.
* Database integration using MongoDB, creating various database models and user CRUD operations using Node.js.
* Using Context API and REST API to pass react components effectively.
* Using React-DOM to efficiently access and update the content of any element of a webpage.
